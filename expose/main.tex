\section*{Expose}

The goal of this thesis is to write a Julia code which can solve the
single-orbital Anderson impurity model on the real frequency axis at zero temperature.
For this end, we will extend an existing code base which uses exact diagonalization
which is limited to tens of bath sites.
The new code should be able to calculate hundreds of bath sites
using a smart choice of basis and ignoring configurations with low probabilities amplitudes.
Once the code is written, it should be tested on the
half-filled Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions.
We aim to obtain the Green's function, spectral function, double occupation, self-energy,
and quasiparticle weight which will be compared against the literature.
One goal of this work is to observe the Mott metal-to-insulator transition
by continuously varying the Coulomb interaction.
