\section{Outline}

In \zcref{ch:models-and-formalism} we describe the necessary model and formalism for this work.
We start by introducing the Bethe lattice and the limit of infinite dimensions.
Afterward we create model Hamiltonians of interacting electrons,
introduce the Green's function formalism and the self-energy.
Finally, we explain DMFT and
arrive at a set of equations which need be solved self-consistently.
