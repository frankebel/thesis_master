\chapter{Results}

In this chapter we show results for our DMFT solver.
The calculations were done using Julia~\cite{Bezanson2017} version 1.11 and 1.12.
The codebase is contained in two packages:
\texttt{Fermions.jl}~\cite{Wallerberger2022} implements
Hamiltonians, wave functions and their interplay.
The second package \texttt{DMFT.jl}\footnote{
    \url{https://github.com/frankebel/DMFT.jl}
}
\fe{
    Should it be moved to the organization \url{https://github.com/tuwien-cms}?
    I'm not part of the organization and don't have permissions.
    Also try to find a better package name?
}
contains the DMFT self-consistency loop with representation of correlators and self-energies.
